# 3d_tile_stats_gen
3d tile statistics generator

This script parses all the mesh files in a 3d tileset, and generates some statistics about the mesh and texture.

Blender needs to be installed as the pythoin script uses it for the heavy lifting of computation.

**Usage**: blender --background --python script.py -- <path_to_tileset.json> <output_csv_filename>
